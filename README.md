# Sentiment Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of sentiment analysis, a subset of text mining, to analyze customer feedback and understand trends. By calculating sentiment polarity and subjectivity, the analysis provides insights into whether textual data contains positive or negative sentiments and the level of subjectivity.

## Features
- Calculates **Sentiment Polarity**: A score ranging from -1 to 1 (negative to positive).
- Calculates **Subjectivity**: A score indicating whether the text is more factual or opinion-based.
- Visualizes data insights with tools such as word clouds and sentiment distributions.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **TextBlob**: For text processing and sentiment computation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **WordCloud**: For generating visual representations of text data.

Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing:
Text cleaning (removing special characters, punctuation, etc.).
Tokenization and normalization.
Sentiment Analysis:
Calculated sentiment polarity and subjectivity scores using the TextBlob library.
Visualization:
Created word clouds and sentiment score distribution plots for better insights.
Outcomes

This project provides a framework for businesses to analyze customer feedback and identify areas for improvement. By interpreting sentiment scores, companies can better understand their customer base and enhance satisfaction.

Future Scope

Extend analysis by categorizing sentiment scores into predefined labels (e.g., Positive, Neutral, Negative).
Integrate a machine learning model for enhanced sentiment classification.
